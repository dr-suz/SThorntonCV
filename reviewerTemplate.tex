\section{Screening Part 1} 
Provide a brief review of the major merits and/or demerits of a paper in light of the following sections/questions. 
\subsection{} Are the problems discussed of substantial interest? Would the solutions of the problems advance theoretical or methodological knowledge? 

\subsection{} Does the author either solve these problems or else make a contribution toward a solution that improves substantially upon previous work? 

\subsection{} Are the methods of solution novel? Do they hold promise of being of use to solve other unsolved problems of interest? 

\subsection{} Does the exposition in the paper help clarify our understanding of this area of research? Does it hold our interest and make us want to give the paper the careful rereading that we give to important papers in our area of research? 

\subsection{} Do the topic and nature of this paper seem appropriate for this journal? Could typical readers of this journal who are less expert than we are in the given area of research read this paper with profit and interest? 

\section{Screening Part 2} 
Consider the key steps of the argument and ask if the assertions make sense in the light of the preceding arguments of the paper, knowledge of similar results in the field, and sense/intuition of what is reasonable to expect to remark on the correctness of the paper.

	My name is Suzanne Thornton and I am writing to apply for a content talent position at Khan Academy. As a college student in the early 2010s, I remember utilizing Khan Academy videos to supplement my studies as a mathematics and statistics major after graduating from a public high school in Florida. Ever since then, my gratefulness for free educational material and support has only grown as has my desire to contribute my talents to these efforts. Khan Academy's dedication to delivering free, world-class education to students aligns with my personal and professional values. %As a life-long learner, I have come to believe that knowledge is second only to compassion. I wish to apply my expertise and grow my skills in a way that protects and supports the human right to education in our advanced age of technology. 
	
	%Since graduate school, I have been heavily involved with service work through the American Statistical Association. 
	After graduating with a PhD in Statistics from Rutgers University in 2019, I began designing and teaching college-level statistics courses at Swarthmore College. As an instructor, I teach statistics as a language of science. Statistical and data literacy are critical skills in our modern workforce and for protecting our rights in an increasingly digital global economy. In the Spring semester of 2020, our college courses abruptly switched to a virtual format amidst the global COVID pandemic. Although this was my first time developing video course content, I received overwhelmingly positive student feedback during these semesters. Furthermore, I intentionally integrated the American Statistical Association's Guidelines for Ethical Practice into my courses and have subsequently published manuscripts on the necessity of ethical considerations for data collection and analysis. 
	
	Finding that Swarthmore College was not a good fit for me, I began working as an associate for the National Institute of Standards and Technology in 2024. Although my current role is not a teaching one, it has provided me with real-world applied statistical problem solving which is invaluable to my future endeavors as a statistics educator. I have appreciated the flexibility of being able to work from home in my current position and I am excited by the possibility of continuing to benefit from a flexible, work-from-home position while furthering my contributions to a quality education for all. 
	
	I am excited about the opportunity to continue my career as an educator with Khan Academy. Please let me know if you have any additional questions for me and feel free to view my professional website (link in footer below) for additional information, including past teaching material. Thank you for your time and consideration.\\
	
	
	%I am the product of the public school system in the USA who has personally benefited from Khan Academy videos in the past. I am forever grateful for freely available, quality  educational material and the role it has played in the success of my career. I wish to apply my expertise and grow my skills in a way that protects and supports the human right to education in our advanced age of technology. I see myself as a life-long learner and I have come to believe that knowledge is second only to compassion.

I am writing to express my interest in the Sr. Research Data Analyst position (117379). With a strong background in statistical analysis and programming, I am excited about the opportunity to apply my skills to support research on reproductive health, maternal and infant outcomes, and health policy. Over the past year, I have worked as an affiliate with the National Institute for Standards of Technology (NIST), where I collaborated with the Statistical Engineering Division on high-precision data analysis. This experience has deepened my expertise in managing large datasets, conducting statistical analyses, and applying data science to real-world challenges.

My passion for public health applications began during my graduate studies when I worked with a physician from Robert Wood Johnson Hospital to develop a predictive model for drug-resistant epilepsy. As the sole statistician on the project, I handled all aspects of data cleaning, model development, and evaluation, leading to a publication in \emph{Neurology}. This experience solidified my interest in using statistical tools to address pressing medical issues, a commitment I have carried forward in my career.

At NIST, I am currently developing a Bayesian measurement error model to more accurately assess the relationship between nanoparticle size and loading, and collaborating with an interdisciplinary team on guidelines for analyzing atomic clock data. These experiences have sharpened my skills in complex statistical modeling and data analysis and  I am eager to apply them to health-related challenges.

In addition to my technical expertise, I bring strong leadership and teamwork skills. My work at NIST has earned me two "Building the Future" grants for projects related to deepfake detection and statistical methods in clock metrology. I was also honored to be nominated by the American Statistical Association for the National Advisory Committee to the US Census and to be selected by the ASA president to lead a working group on LGBTQ+ inclusion within the field. My leadership philosophy prioritizes fostering inclusive, collaborative environments where diverse perspectives can thrive. These qualities make me well-suited for the collaborative research environment at Johns Hopkins.

I am excited about the possibility of contributing to research that addresses critical public health challenges. My technical expertise, combined with my passion for interdisciplinary collaboration, positions me well to contribute meaningfully to your team. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills align with the needs of your research projects.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions for me and feel free to view my professional website (link in footer) for additional information. Thank you for your time and consideration.\\

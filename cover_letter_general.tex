	My name is Suzanne Thornton. I am currently working at Swarthmore College as an assistant professor of statistics but I am interested in changing my career.... I am writing to apply for the XXXX position at XXXX.\\ \vspace{.5cm}
	% joint position of assistant professor with the Cognitive and Statistical Sciences to begin in July 2019.\\ \vspace{1cm} 
	
	Though the submission of my application is occurring before I have begun my duties at Swarthmore, as a doctoral student, my work focused on statistical computing methods driven by complex, real-world data. In particular, my research explores possible connections among Bayesian and frequentist methods through the development of new computational tools for inference. The quality of my research has been recognized though several student paper awards. Three years of applied experience as a part-time statistical consultant have also provided me with experience collaborating with scientists from other disciplines. These collaborations ultimately resulted in publications and an applied project that will be included in my doctoral thesis. Academic service has also been an important part of my training. I have served as a student mentor through a research program for undergraduate students at the Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science at Rutgers. As a graduate student, I have also taught introductory regression courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. I am also particularly passionate about advancing women and other minorities in the mathematical and statistical sciences. This year, some collaborators and I published a couple of articles in Significance magazine where we advocate for visible allyship with LGBT+ individuals in statistics and data science.
	%  Earlier this year, I organized a conference panel session to advocate for the visibility of LGBTQ people in statistics and data science, an effort which is being continued in the form of a prepared publication and future conference sessions in 2019.\\
